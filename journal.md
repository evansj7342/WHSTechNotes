My thought on the new phone law is that it is bad. My school is lucky because all we have to do is put it in our bags, but in other schools you have to put them in a phone pouch and keep it there for the entire day. I was thinking about the phone pouches, and it is a bad decision. It seems like a dystopian decision. They should also let you have it during lunch, because there is no point not to.

I want to mostly have a career in video game design, music, or a youtuber. Computer Science can help me with problem solving or overall performance. If I wanted to have a career in Video Game Design, my experience in computer science could improve in that category. The experience in computer science can make dealing with technology easier. Computer Science can help you understand technology way better, so that doing simple tasks isn't such a hard ask.

I think that the virtual store will be a good thing. It can make people who can't get jobs have a chance to work and earn money. Adding virtual stores will be a good future for jobs in general. Sometimes the job market isn't a good place to be and the virtual stores could fix that. If the IKEA virtual store takes off, there could be alot more virtual stores in the future.

I asked Canva AI to make an educational video about the letters of the alphabet. Canva only interpreted it by creating photos and not videos. The interactive parts that worked were the photos. A way that I could improve my prompt was to only give it a selection of photos. Canva AI has a paid feature to make video clips.
