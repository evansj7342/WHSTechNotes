My thought on the new phone law is that it is bad. My school is lucky because all we have to do is put it in our bags, but in other schools you have to put them in a phone pouch and keep it there for the entire day. I was thinking about the phone pouches, and it is a bad decision. It seems like a dystopian decision. They should also let you have it during lunch, because there is no point not to.

I want to mostly have a career in video game design, music, or a youtuber. Computer Science can help me with problem solving or overall performance. If I wanted to have a career in Video Game Design, my experience in computer science could improve in that category. The experience in computer science can make dealing with technology easier. Computer Science can help you understand technology way better, so that doing simple tasks isn't such a hard ask.
