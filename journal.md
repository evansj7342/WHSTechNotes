My thought on the new phone law is that it is bad. My school is lucky because all we have to do is put it in our bags, but in other schools you have to put them in a phone pouch and keep it there for the entire day. I was thinking about the phone pouches, and it is a bad decision. It seems like a dystopian decision. They should also let you have it during lunch, because there is no point not to.

I want to mostly have a career in video game design, music, or a youtuber. Computer Science can help me with problem solving or overall performance. If I wanted to have a career in Video Game Design, my experience in computer science could improve in that category. The experience in computer science can make dealing with technology easier. Computer Science can help you understand technology way better, so that doing simple tasks isn't such a hard ask.

I think that the virtual store will be a good thing. It can make people who can't get jobs have a chance to work and earn money. Adding virtual stores will be a good future for jobs in general. Sometimes the job market isn't a good place to be and the virtual stores could fix that. If the IKEA virtual store takes off, there could be alot more virtual stores in the future.

I asked Canva AI to make an educational video about the letters of the alphabet. Canva only interpreted it by creating photos and not videos. The interactive parts that worked were the photos. A way that I could improve my prompt was to only give it a selection of photos. Canva AI has a paid feature to make video clips.

I think that being able to use technology to help people during a natural disaster is a life saving revolution. Some areas don't get a notification that a disaster is happening, so people get killed in the disasters. I believe that this can help solve that issue. It's also really efficient to use, since alot of places have internet. One downside is that some areas can't use it due to lack of internet.

What I am going to do over thanksgiving break is catch up on sleep and play games. I would say eat the food too, but my parents make cornbread, black eyed peas, and greens, which I find disgusting. Hopefully this year they find a good turkey or good chicken to eat, because I hated thanksgiving for the food they give me. I guess bad food is better than no food, though.

I think drones are useful for everyday life. A job that uses drones is a drone programmer. The salary for a drone programmer according to google is $62,000 to $116,000 annualy. Drone programmers write code for the drone to fly around or capture footage. This is usually how you can get photos of cities from really high up.
